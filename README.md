# Fault-Analysis
Given a raw dataset of faults in several switches of a PV Converter topology, we try to classify the faults in switches through a simple artificial neural network. 
Training accuracy = 70.37%.
Validation accuracy = 85.06%.
Testing Accuracy = 82.75%.
The accuracy scores of all three sets varies slightly (about 2-3%) with a change in the random state(shuffling of the datasets).

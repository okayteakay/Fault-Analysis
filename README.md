# Fault-Analysis
Given a raw dataset of faults in several switches of a PV Converter topology, we try to classify the faults in switches through several multi-class classification Machine Learning Models and a Neural Network model.
Test Accuracy Scores:
Neural Network - 77% (about 4-5% variation with change in random state can also be achieved for better accuracy),
Desicion Trees - 99.07% ,
SVM- 86.1%,
KNN- 86.1% &
Naive Bayes Classifier - 80.5%
